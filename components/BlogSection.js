              Why Capitol Stack Exists: A Better Way to Back Climate Builders
            </h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-[#4B5563]">By Jason Cahill, Managing Director, Capitol Stack</p>

              The next generation of climate innovation won’t come from Silicon Valley alone. It will come from the halls of government, the labs of the DOE, the field ops of USAID, and the spreadsheets of EPA analysts who’ve spent years navigating systems that are slow to move—but impossible to ignore.
            </p>
            <p>Capitol Stack was founded to back those people.</p>
            <p>
              We invest in mission-driven founders emerging from public institutions and technical infrastructure sectors—people who understand how systems work, because they helped build or manage them. Our founders may have once held government IDs or security clearances, but now they want to move fast and fix the things that policy alone can’t.
            </p>
            <p>
              The D.C. region is brimming with this kind of talent. It has the highest per capita number of CS and STEM graduates in the country. Many of those people are now looking for their next mission—whether due to shifting politics, layoffs, or a desire to drive impact more directly. At the same time, LPs are looking for grounded, execution-first approaches to climate investing. We believe Capitol Stack is the convergence point.
            </p>
            <p>
              We offer capital, frameworks, and community for these overlooked but deeply capable builders. Not flashy. Not hype-driven. Just people who know what they’re doing and are ready to build.
            </p>
            <p>If you’re one of them—or want to back them—we’d love to talk.</p>
