### The Myth of the Pure Equity Path

Climate founders are often told to follow the well-trodden VC path: pre-seed → seed → Series A.  
But that playbook was built for SaaS, not solar, cement, or grid robotics.

**Blended finance** is the strategic stacking of capital — from federal grants to concessionary debt — to reduce founder dilution while accelerating real-world progress. And it’s no longer niche.

- **Over $300B in U.S. federal climate funding** is available through the IRA, IIJA, and CHIPS Acts — [White House Guidebook](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/)
- **Catalytic capital providers** like Prime Coalition and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst back risky, early deployments — [Prime Coalition](https://primecoalition.org/)
- **LPO debt** can underwrite first-of-a-kind projects with low-interest loans — [DOE LPO](https://www.energy.gov/lpo)

### Anatomy of a Stack That Works

| Layer | Example | Benefit |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Grant** | ARPA-E Open Topic, $1.2M | Technical derisking, zero dilution |
| **Catalytic Equity** | Prime Coalition, $500K | Risk-tolerant early capital |
| **Concessionary Debt** | LPO, $10M | 2–3% interest, infra-scale validation |
| **Commercial VC** | $5M Series A | Adds GTM firepower without front-loading dilution |

### Case Snapshot — Battery-Recycling Startup

- **Capital Stack**: $2.1M SBIR Phase II + $6M catalytic equity + $20M LPO conditional
- **Impact**: Cut Series A raise from $15M to $6M and kept 20% more founder equity
- **Bonus**: LPO commitment unlocked a state tax incentive for the pilot site

### Three Myths Busted

1. **"Grants take forever"** – True for rookies. But insiders with agency relationships close in <90 days.
2. **"VCs hate blended stacks"** – Only bad ones. Top funds love derisked, capital-efficient paths to ARR.
3. **"Debt is risky"** – Not if it's revenue-contingent or tied to an offtake. Learn the terms.

### Checklist for Founders

- [ ] Have you mapped non-dilutive sources by stage and geography?
- [ ] Do you understand the reporting burden and how to manage it?
- [ ] Can you articulate the catalytic effect to equity investors?

Cap tables tell a story. Blended finance helps you write a better one.

**Founders**: Want to map your blended stack? Let’s talk.  
**LPs**: Want non-obvious access to de-risked early-stage climate bets? You know where to find us.
