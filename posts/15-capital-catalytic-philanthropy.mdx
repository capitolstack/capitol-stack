## Catalytic Capital: Not Just for Charity

Climate philanthropy has entered a new era. Once the realm of research grants and awareness campaigns, it's now a sophisticated tool for unlocking commercial adoption and de-risking climate innovation.

When used well, catalytic capital:

- Validates tech before the market catches up  
- Unlocks matching government or multilateral funding  
- Creates first-use cases for solutions stuck in the “valley of death”

Philanthropy isn’t the soft money—it’s the spark money.

## Case in Point: Groundwork for the Grid

GridLab and Energy Innovation are two of the unsung heroes here. With funding from the Heising-Simons and ClimateWorks foundations, they’ve equipped regulators and grid operators with scenario modeling, shaping IRPs that later unlocked billions in transmission upgrades.

> The [Heising-Simons Foundation](https://www.hsfoundation.org/) gave early support to modeling tools now used across 20+ states.

Meanwhile, prime recipients of catalytic philanthropy—like [Prime Coalition](https://primecoalition.org/)—have backed companies like Lilac Solutions and Sublime Systems before traditional VCs had the risk tolerance.

## What LPs Should Know

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Foundation-backed pilot | Builds credibility and de-risks tech validation |
| Blended fund model (like Prime or Activate Capital) | Catalyzes follow-on investment, builds momentum |
| Mission-aligned milestones | Reduces misalignment between founders and early backers |

Philanthropic dollars, when wired smartly, aren’t charity—they’re leverage.

## Checklist for Founders and LPs

- Have you mapped out catalytic funders in your domain (climate resilience, built environment, grid, etc.)?
- Can you demonstrate how early grant or PRIs enable proof points for commercial follow-on?
- Are your milestones structured to convert “impact-first” capital into “market-first” confidence?

At Capitol Stack, we look for these leverage points. We write checks where philanthropy has cleared the brush—and the path forward leads to scale.
