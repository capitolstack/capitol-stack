summary: "Most enterprise pilots aren’t proof of product-market fit. But when done right—with budget, urgency, and commitment—they’re the springboard to scale."

Enterprise pilots are a rite of passage in climate tech—but too often, they’re a dead end.

Why? Because many early pilots lack the one thing that turns a project into a launchpad: **commitment**.

The difference between a time-suck trial and a real wedge into the market often comes down to three factors:

## 1. Budgeted, Not Borrowed

The pilot is funded from an existing budget line—not scraped together from favors, “innovation” carve-outs, or afterthought grants.

If the buyer has skin in the game, you’ll see it in the form of:

- An assigned procurement officer
- A signed SOW with clear KPIs
- Timelines that match business urgency

## 2. Executive Sponsorship

The team buying your pilot may not be the one rolling it out—or greenlighting the scale-up.

> “Show me your champion’s boss.”  
> That’s who we want to meet.

When executive sponsors show up to onboarding or demo day, it signals the project matters beyond the pilot phase.

## 3. Post-Pilot Path

A pilot is only meaningful if it’s the first step in a clearly defined journey:

- Is there a budget line for expansion?
- Have procurement thresholds been mapped?
- Is legal ready to move to MSA?

We love seeing pilots structured with **opt-out clauses**, not just renewals. If it works, the default is scale.

### Case Snapshot: SmartHVAC Co.

- **Customer**: Fortune 100 with LEED retrofits underway
- **Pilot**: 3-building install funded via energy ops budget
- **Outcomes**: Verified 11% HVAC savings; KPIs met 45 days early
- **Scale Path**: Contract pre-wired for 200-building rollout

That’s not a pilot—it’s a **wedge**.

### Founder Checklist

- [ ] Is this pilot tied to a named, recurring budget?
- [ ] Do I have buy-in from someone above the innovation team?
- [ ] Have I documented the exact steps from pilot to rollout?

Pilots aren’t just tests of technology. They’re tests of intent.  
When the buyer shows up committed, the pilot becomes traction—not just a science fair project.

**At Capitol Stack**, we fund teams who structure for scale from day one.  
If your pilot is really a beachhead, we want to hear from you.
