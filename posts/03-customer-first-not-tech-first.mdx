In climate tech it’s easy to fall in love with the tech — your elegant algorithm, your breakthrough chemistry, your cleverly-optimized control system.  
But the graveyard of climate startups is filled with great ideas that never found a customer.

The best climate companies don’t start with **code**.  
They start with **customers** — specifically, customers in pain.

Because the difference between something that demos well and something that scales fast isn’t technical sophistication; it’s **urgency**. Urgency turns exploration into commitment. Urgency closes deals. Urgency is the lifeblood of traction.

This is where we separate **pain-killers** from **vitamins**.

### Pain That Signs Checks

| Customer               | Burning Platform                                                                                                                  | What They’ll Buy (Today)                                                                                         |

Three Customer-First Habits

1. **Budget archaeology** – Map line items, fiscal calendars, and authority limits *before* sprint planning.  
2. **Procurement path-finding** – Treat RFP templates and indemnity clauses as design inputs, not after-thoughts.  
3. **Pilot-kill deadlines** – Contracts that auto-convert to paid deployment unless the customer opts out.

### Mini Case — From Idea → Paid Pilot on a Shoestring

| Pillar     | Insider Wedge (Pre-Seed Reality)                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code       | Founder spent 4 yrs in a utility data-ops team; left with 10 TB of anonymized fault logs and Python notebooks the utility granted for research. |
| Capital    | $450k NSF SBIR Phase I + $200k angels — just enough runway to build the MVP and clear the utility’s cyber-security audit. |
| Customer   | Municipal utility (250k meters) signed an LOI + $30k paid pilot contingent on cyber-audit pass; target = 5% truck-roll reduction. |
| Community  | Private Slack of 35 grid-ops peers supplies sample data, bug reports, and candidate referrals — zero recruiter fees. |

### Checklist — Are You Ready?

- [ ] Can you point to the *exact* budget line that pays for your product?  
- [ ] Do you solve a 2025 regulatory headache, or just look futuristic?  
- [ ] Will ignoring you **hurt** your buyer this quarter?

Innovation doesn’t move markets — **adoption** does. And adoption belongs to founders who speak *customer before code*.
