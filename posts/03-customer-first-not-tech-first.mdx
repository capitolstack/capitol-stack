### Mini Case — From Idea → Paid Pilot on a Shoestring

| Pillar     | Insider Wedge (Pre-Seed Reality)                                                                                                                                   |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code**       | Founder left utility data ops with 10 TB of fault logs + Python scripts legally granted.                                                                 |
| **Capital**    | $450k NSF SBIR Phase I + $200k angels — just enough to get past MVP + cyber-audit.                                                                          |
| **Customer**   | Utility (250k meters) signed LOI + $30k paid pilot contingent on audit pass; aimed at 5% truck-roll reduction.                                               |
| **Community**  | Slack of 35 grid-ops peers provided bug reports, sample data, and candidate referrals — zero recruiter fees.                                                 |

### Three Customer-First Habits

1. **Budget archaeology** – Map line items, fiscal calendars, and authority limits *before* sprint planning.  
2. **Procurement path-finding** – Treat RFP templates and indemnity clauses as design inputs, not after-thoughts.  
3. **Pilot-kill deadlines** – Contracts that auto-convert to paid deployment unless the customer opts out.

### Checklist — Are You Ready?

- [ ] Can you point to the *exact* budget line that pays for your product?  
- [ ] Do you solve a 2025 regulatory headache, or just look futuristic?  
- [ ] Will ignoring you **hurt** your buyer this quarter?

Innovation doesn’t move markets — **adoption** does. And adoption belongs to founders who speak *customer before code*.
