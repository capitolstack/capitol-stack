In climate tech it’s easy to fall in love with the tech — your elegant algorithm, your breakthrough chemistry, your cleverly-optimized control system.  
But the graveyard of climate startups is filled with great ideas that never found a customer.

The best climate companies don’t start with **code**.  
They start with **customers** — specifically, customers in pain.

Because the difference between something that demos well and something that scales fast isn’t technical sophistication; it’s **urgency**. Urgency turns exploration into commitment. Urgency closes deals. Urgency is the lifeblood of traction.

This is where we separate **pain-killers** from **vitamins**.

## Pain That Signs Checks

| Customer in Pain | Burning Platform | What They’ll Buy (Today) |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Electric utilities** | 40-year-old grid meets AI-era loads + RE targets; 60-70 % say they’ll lean on AI for congestion/outage risk by 2030 | Any software that removes a truck-roll or a reliability penalty. |
| **NYC REIT owners** | Local Law 97 fines begin in 2025 — up to \$268/ton | Turn-key retrofit orchestration that spits out compliance docs. |
| **Enterprise shippers** | Scope 3 rules force disclosure of every diesel mile | Route-optimization that chops fuel *and* pipes data into CDP reports. |
| **K-12 school districts** | \$500 M *Renew America’s Schools* grants but zero staff capacity | Grant-to-project bundles: heat pumps or solar PPAs filed and managed for them. |

### Three Customer-First Habits

1. **Budget archaeology** – Map line items, fiscal calendars, and authority limits *before* sprint planning.  
2. **Procurement path-finding** – Treat RFP templates and indemnity clauses as design inputs, not after-thoughts.  
3. **Pilot-kill deadlines** – Contracts that auto-convert to paid deployment unless the customer opts out.

### Mini Case — From Idea to Paid Pilot on a Shoestring

| Pillar | Insider Wedge (Pre-Seed Reality) |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Code** | Founder spent 4 years in a utility data-ops team; left with a **10 TB** trove of anonymized fault logs and Python notebooks the utility legally granted for research. |
| **Capital** | **\$450 k NSF SBIR Phase I + \$200 k angels** — just enough runway to prove MVP and pass the utility’s cyber-security checklist. |
| **Customer** | Municipal utility (250 k meters) signed an **LOI + \$30 k paid pilot** contingent on cyber-audit pass. Target: 5 % truck-roll reduction. |
| **Community** | Private Slack of **35 grid-ops friends** supplies sample data, bug reports, candidate referrals — zero recruiter fees. |

*Outcome:* MVP deployed on a read-only data feed, flagged six latent pole failures in Month 1 → pilot converted to a \$120 k/yr SaaS contract after 90 days. Team now raising a \$1.5 M seed on real ARR, not promises.

### Checklist — Are You Ready?

- [ ] Can you point to the *exact* budget line that pays for your product?  
- [ ] Do you solve a 2025 regulatory headache, or just look futuristic?  
- [ ] Will ignoring you **hurt** your buyer this quarter?

Innovation doesn’t move markets — **adoption** does. And adoption belongs to founders who speak *customer before code*.
