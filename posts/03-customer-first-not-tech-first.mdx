In climate tech it’s easy to fall in love with the tech — your elegant algorithm, your breakthrough chemistry, your cleverly-optimized control system.  
But the graveyard of climate startups is filled with great ideas that never found a customer.

The best climate companies don’t start with **code**.  
They start with **customers** — specifically, customers in pain.

Because the difference between something that demos well and something that scales fast isn’t technical sophistication; it’s **urgency**. Urgency turns exploration into commitment. Urgency closes deals. Urgency is the lifeblood of traction.

This is where we separate **pain-killers** from **vitamins**.

## Pain That Signs Checks

| Customer in Pain    | Burning Platform                                                                                                      | What They’ll Buy (Today)                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Electric utilities** | 40-yr-old grid meets AI-era load; RE targets; 60-70 % say they’ll lean on AI for congestion/outage risk by 2030 | Anything that removes a truck-roll or avoids a penalty       |
| **NYC REIT owners** | Local Law 97 fines begin 2025 — up to \$268/ton                                                                        | Turn-key retrofit orchestration + auto-generated compliance  |
| **Enterprise shippers** | SEC Scope 3 rules force disclosure of every diesel mile                                                           | Route-optimisation that cuts fuel *and* feeds CDP reports    |
| **K-12 school districts** | \$500 M *Renew America’s Schools* grants but zero staff capacity                                                | Grant-to-project bundles: heat pumps / solar PPAs filed for them |

### Three Customer-First Habits

1. **Budget archaeology** – Map line items, fiscal calendars, and authority limits *before* sprint planning.  
2. **Procurement path-finding** – Treat RFP templates and indemnity clauses as design inputs, not after-thoughts.  
3. **Pilot-kill deadlines** – Contracts that auto-convert to paid deployment unless the customer opts out.

### Mini Case — From Idea → Paid Pilot on a Shoestring

| Pillar   | Insider Wedge (Pre-Seed Reality)                                                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code** | 4 yrs in utility data-ops → leaves with **10 TB** of anonymised fault logs + python notebooks legally granted for research        |
| **Capital** | **\$450 k NSF SBIR Phase I + \$200 k angels** — just enough to build MVP & pass the utility’s cyber audit                    |
| **Customer** | Municipal utility (250 k meters) signs **LOI + \$30 k paid pilot** contingent on cyber-pass; target = 5 % truck-roll cut   |
| **Community** | Private Slack of **35 grid-ops friends** supplies sample data, bug reports, candidate referrals — zero recruiter fees       |

*Outcome:* MVP read-only on live feed, flags 6 latent pole failures in month 1 → pilot converts to \$120 k/yr SaaS after 90 days; now raising \$1.5 M seed on real ARR.

### Checklist — Are You Ready?

- [ ] Can you point to the *exact* budget line that pays for your product?  
- [ ] Do you solve a 2025 regulatory headache, or just look futuristic?  
- [ ] Will ignoring you **hurt** your buyer this quarter?

Innovation doesn’t move markets — **adoption** does. And adoption belongs to founders who speak *customer before code*.
