In climate tech, it's easy to fall in love with the tech — your elegant algorithm, your breakthrough chemistry, your cleverly optimized control system. But the graveyard of climate startups is filled with great ideas that never found a customer.

The best climate companies don’t start with code.  
They start with customers.

Specifically, **customers in pain.**

Because the difference between a company that demos well and one that scales fast isn't technical sophistication — it’s urgency. Urgency turns exploration into commitment. Urgency closes deals. Urgency is the lifeblood of traction.

This is where we separate painkillers from vitamins.

### Mini Case — From Idea to Paid Pilot on a Shoestring

| Pillar | Insider Wedge (Pre‑Seed Reality) |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Code** | Founder spent 4 years in a utility data‑ops team, left with a **10 TB** trove of anonymized fault logs and Python notebooks the utility legally granted for research use. |
| **Capital** | **$450 k NSF SBIR Phase I + $200 k angels**—just enough runway to prove MVP and meet the utility’s cyber‑security checklist. |
| **Customer** | Municipal utility (250 k meters) signed an **LOI + $30 k paid pilot** contingent on cyber‑audit pass. Project targets 5 % truck‑roll reduction. |
| **Community** | Private Slack of **35 grid‑ops friends** provides sample data, bug reports, and candidate referrals—zero recruiter fees. |

*Outcome:* MVP deployed on a read‑only data feed, detected six latent pole failures in the first month → pilot converted to a $120 k/year SaaS contract after 90 days. Founders now prepping a $1.5 M seed with that ARR as proof.
