In climate tech, it's easy to fall in love with the tech — your elegant algorithm, your breakthrough chemistry, your cleverly optimized control system. But let’s be honest: the graveyard of climate startups is filled with great ideas that never found a customer.

The best climate companies don’t start with code.  
They start with customers.

Specifically, **customers in pain.**

Because the difference between a company that demos well and one that scales fast isn't technical sophistication — it’s urgency. Urgency turns exploration into commitment. Urgency closes deals. Urgency is the lifeblood of traction.

This is where we separate painkillers from vitamins.

In other words: does someone **need** this now? Or do they just think it's *nice*?

That distinction matters more in climate tech than anywhere else. Because policy windows close. Budgets get reallocated. Infrastructure lasts decades. And buyers don’t have time to experiment on science projects.

A few examples:

- **Utilities** aren’t browsing for shiny new platforms. They’re scrambling to balance grid volatility, decarbonization mandates, and equity concerns — all while avoiding rate hikes. If you can solve even one sliver of that, you’ve got a shot.
- **REITs and property managers** don’t want “smart building optimization.” They want to pass their audits, avoid fines, and make ESG reports painless. Make that happen, and your software sells itself.
- **Fleet operators** don’t care about your data lake until it helps them hit Scope 3 targets under pressure from their biggest customers.
- **School districts** have access to Inflation Reduction Act funds. But most are buried in procurement red tape and lack the capacity to deploy. A founder who helps them cut through that chaos — that’s the real innovation.

Customer-first doesn’t mean customer-only.  
You still need a technical edge. A proprietary wedge. A reason you win.

But if your startup isn’t rooted in a **real, knowable, urgent problem** — you’re not a climate founder. You’re a climate tourist.

At Capitol Stack, we back startups that speak **customer before code.**

That means:

- Talking to buyers before building  
- Understanding budgets and barriers before launch  
- Designing go-to-market strategies around friction, not fantasy  

Because innovation isn’t what changes the world.  
**Adoption** is.

And adoption only happens when someone’s hurting — and your startup is the painkiller.
