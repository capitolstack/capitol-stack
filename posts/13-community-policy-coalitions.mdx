In climate, policy isn’t just context — it’s code. And founders who treat coalitions as strategic infrastructure build better moats.

## Coalitions as Code

Climate regulation moves markets. From IRA credits to state-level ESG mandates, the rules shape where capital flows and which business models work.

Founders who partner with advocacy orgs, trade groups, and think tanks don’t just watch policy—they help write it.

### Examples That Move the Needle

- **Advanced Energy United**: State-level coalition influencing clean energy procurement rules across 27 states – [advancedenergyunited.org](https://www.advancedenergyunited.org/)
- **Heat Pump Coalition**: Multi-stakeholder group driving residential retrofit standards and workforce dev – [Rewiring America](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/)
- **Open Source Climate Policy Models**: Groups like [RMI](https://rmi.org) creating accessible policy frameworks that startups can test against.

### How Community Becomes a Policy Weapon

1. **Feedback Loops** – Founders share ground-truth with allies who have DC access.
2. **Alignment = Access** – Shared agenda earns trust with policymakers, paving the way for inclusion in pilot programs and grants.
3. **Speed to Trust** – Investors and customers move faster when they know you’re policy-aligned and coalition-backed.

### The Capitol Stack POV

We look for startups who aren’t just heads-down builders — but movement-aware players who plug into broader narratives.

Coalitions don’t dilute your edge. They multiply it.

### Founder Checklist

- Have you joined a policy working group or coalition in your sector?
- Do you have allies monitoring bills and rules that affect your GTM path?
- Can your product roadmap benefit from direct regulator input?

If yes to two or more: you’re probably already building a policy moat. Now let’s deepen it.
