## Where Startups Stall

Everyone loves the phrase: “The government is the biggest customer in the world.” But for most climate startups, the public sector is a tantalizing dead-end—long cycles, rigid rules, and endless compliance.

The truth? Most founders don’t fail because their product isn’t good enough. They fail because they never figured out **how** to sell it to government.

## RFPs Aren’t the Starting Line

By the time an RFP hits SAM.gov, the game is already in motion. The specs are written, the vendors are often pre-wired, and startups are playing catch-up.

> Great government sellers never start with an RFP.  
> They start with a problem statement—and a champion inside the agency.

Translation and timing matter. Founders who win public contracts understand not only how to make their solution compliant, but how to make it **familiar**.

## Insider Selling Tips That Work

- **Pre-Engage Before Budget Season**: Agencies allocate funds 6–18 months in advance. Meet them *before* the fiscal year sets the deck.
- **Piggyback on a GSA Schedule**: If you’re not on one, partner with someone who is. Speed is procurement gold.
- **Tell the Policy Story**: Connect your solution directly to a funded initiative—IRA, IIJA, or local resilience goals.
