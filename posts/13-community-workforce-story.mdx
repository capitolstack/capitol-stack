## Talent isn’t a perk—it’s the bottleneck

While Silicon Valley obsesses over 10x engineers, climate founders face a more foundational question: **Who’s going to do the work?**

By 2030, the U.S. needs to fill **1 million+** climate-related skilled labor roles—electricians, HVAC techs, plumbers, linemen, agronomists, and more ([Rewiring America](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/policy/the-workforce-opportunity)). Yet startups often treat workforce like a late-stage worry, not a design constraint.

Smart founders build *for* the workforce—and *with* them—from day one.

## Community-first hiring = faster traction

A founder who grew up in a family of HVAC techs built a decarb retrofit startup. Instead of recruiting from LinkedIn, she embedded at community colleges, retrained 22 tradespeople in 3 months, and landed a GSA pilot six weeks later.

Why it worked:

- **Worker fluency** → trusted onboarding  
- **Union touchpoints** → smooth procurement  
- **Local pride** → faster installs + lower churn  

> Workforce isn't a nice-to-have. It's the moat, the margin, and the multiplier.

## Climate Tech’s People Stack

| Layer                | Role in the Flywheel |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Skilled trades**   | Install, operate, and maintain infrastructure at scale |
| **Community colleges** | On-ramps to climate careers (especially for displaced workers) |
| **Unions / guilds**  | Deployment allies with trust and negotiating leverage |
| **Local nonprofits** | Workforce dev partners who understand cultural + regional nuance |

## Founder Checklist

- Have you budgeted for workforce training or partnerships?  
- Do you understand the culture + incentives of your frontline workers?  
- Can you reduce turnover through better onboarding or equity participation?
