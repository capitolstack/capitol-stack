### 1. What’s the FOAK Gap?

The **first-of-a-kind (FOAK)** gap is the most deadly stretch of a climate startup’s journey. It’s what happens between a successful pilot and bankable project finance. At this point:

- VC says it’s too capital-intensive.
- Banks say it’s too risky.
- Customers say, “Come back when someone else has tried it.”

As a result, many climate hardware or infra-light startups stall, not because the tech fails—but because the capital stack doesn’t exist yet.

> “FOAK is where great companies go to die if nobody bridges the financing gap.” — Jason Cahill

### 2. Why It Happens

- **Venture flight:** Most VCs underwrite to software-like returns. When IRR is hard to model, they flee.
- **Infra hesitation:** Project finance needs de-risked assets with known cash flows. FOAK deployments don’t qualify.
- **Mismatch of timelines:** FOAK can take 18–36 months to execute. That doesn’t work on 10-year fund cycles.

### 3. Who’s Trying to Solve It?

- **Loan Programs Office (LPO)** – Under the Inflation Reduction Act, LPO has more than **$400B in capacity** to underwrite early infrastructure projects. But startups need help navigating the process. ([DOE LPO Overview](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/loan-programs-office))
- **Catalytic capital** – Groups like [Prime Coalition](https://primecoalition.org/) and [CEG Catalyst Fund](https://www.cleanegroup.org/ceg-projects/catalyst/) offer subordinated equity or recoverable grants.
- **Corporate offtake agreements** – Forward contracts or pre-purchase deals can serve as credit enhancement for FOAK builds.

### 4. What Founders Can Do

- **FOAK financial modeling** – Build conservative project pro formas *early*. Know your DSCR, tax credit exposure, and O&M assumptions.
- **Stack the stack** – Combine LPO debt, philanthropic grants, and revenue-linked notes creatively.
- **Find “first-follower” customers** – These aren’t the bleeding-edge buyers. They’re the ones with the balance sheet to co-finance.

### 5. Capitol Stack’s Take

We specialize in the messy middle—between grant-funded R&D and institutional project finance. FOAK is where moats get built and alpha gets mispriced.

If you’re staring down your first commercial deployment and wondering who will underwrite it: we might be your people.

👉 **Talk to us.** We’ve seen this movie before—and backed the ones who crossed the gap.
