# Buying Committees Are Your Real Customer

In climate tech, there’s no such thing as a single buyer.

Whether you’re selling to a utility, a school district, or a real estate REIT, your customer isn’t a person—it’s a **committee**. And that committee has conflicting incentives, overlapping budgets, and different risk profiles. If you want your pilot to convert, you need to sell to all of them.

That’s where most founders trip up.

## 1. The Buying Committee in Climate

Here’s what a typical committee looks like in a utility deployment:

- **Operations Lead**: Wants to reduce downtime.
- **IT/Cybersecurity**: Fears another vendor security hole.
- **Finance/Admin**: Needs you to fit into a multi-year capex model.
- **Legal**: Reviews indemnity, insurance, and export controls.
- **Program Owner**: Believes in your value—but can’t sign alone.

Your job isn’t just to win the champion. It’s to **arm** them to win the room.

## 2. Case Study — The $180k That Got Stuck in Legal

A climate SaaS startup had a municipal LOI, enthusiastic program director, and a working demo. But the city attorney had a clause requiring the vendor to indemnify *any* third-party claims related to emissions tracking. Deal stalled for 9 months.

A simple fix—co-authored contract language used in another agency—cleared the path. But only because the founder knew how to navigate all roles, not just the champion.

## 3. Tools to Map the Org Chart

1. **Decision RACI**: Who’s Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed?
2. **Procurement Timeline**: Fiscal year, grant windows, board review cycles?
3. **Policy Risk Sensitivity**: Who fears audits vs. who fears public blowback?

[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale) calls this the “consensus sale”—and it’s vital in regulated industries.

## 4. Sales Enablement Isn’t Just for the CRO

If your startup has no sales team, you’re it. Your pitch isn’t just a deck—it’s:

- An ROI calculator for finance.
- A one-pager for the legal team.
- A security protocol FAQ for IT.
- A compliance snapshot for public boards.

You’re not just selling software. You’re **de-risking a decision** for 5–10 stakeholders.

## 5. Checklist — Ready for a Complex Sale?

- Have you mapped the RACI across your top prospect?
- Do you know the legal/procurement deal-breakers ahead of time?
- Are your sales materials tailored for each stakeholder, not just the champion?

Founders who sell to one person rarely win. Founders who sell to ten—do.

**Capitol Stack** was built for the founders who can win the committee. Let’s talk.
