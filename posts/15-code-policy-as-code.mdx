summary: "When founders know how to write policy as well as they write code, they unlock unfair advantages in climate markets."
description: "In climate, policy is product. Founders who treat regulation like source code—iterating, debugging, and deploying—build faster, deeper moats and avoid regulatory dead ends."

## 1. Regulation Is Not the Enemy — It's the Architecture

Founders often see policy as a barrier. But in climate, **policy is product**. Treating it like code—written, versioned, and deployed—lets startups lead instead of follow.

The best climate founders **shape** policy. Whether testifying before state commissions or working with nonprofits to draft bills, these founders are pulling levers most teams ignore.

- The [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/) baked in over $370B in climate incentives. Founders who helped draft its language are now first in line to benefit.
- [Rewiring America](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/) shows how startups can become policy collaborators, not just beneficiaries.
- A [2024 BCG study](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/climate-advocacy-strategy-for-businesses) showed companies with early policy engagement had a **32% faster path to commercial scale**.

## 2. What “Policy as Code” Really Means

- **Version Control:** Track legislative drafts and amendments like Git commits.  
- **Feedback Loops:** Use field deployments to suggest updates to rules or pilot waivers.  
- **Compliance by Design:** Build regulatory constraints into product UX from day one.

Think of it as an API layer between innovation and government. Those who speak both dialects win faster.

## 3. Mini Case — ZEROGRID

- **CODE:** Former FERC staffer turned founder builds solar-permit engine that adapts to local rules in real time.
- **CAPITAL:** Closed a $5M seed round, including mission-aligned policy funders.
- **CUSTOMER:** Partnered with 4 municipalities who helped write the permitting templates.
- **COMMUNITY:** Built a working group with solar installers and county inspectors—resulting in a 68% drop in permit time.

> "Policy was our launch partner. We just wrote it like code."

## 4. Checklist — Is Your Startup Policy-Ready?

- [ ] Do you have a map of relevant federal/state/local regulations?  
- [ ] Are any of your team advisors ex-agency or regulatory insiders?  
- [ ] Have you contributed to a working group, RFI, or rule-making process?  
- [ ] Do you view regulation as static or as an evolving system you can improve?

If your answer to the last question is “evolving system,” you’re already thinking in code.
