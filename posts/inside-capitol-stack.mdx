The next great climate companies won’t be built by outsiders.  
They’re already inside.

Inside the agencies writing the policy.  
Inside the utilities navigating net-zero mandates.  
Inside the labs prototyping hydrogen membranes.  
Inside the communities living with the consequences of delay.

At **Capitol Stack**, we exist to back these founders — the ones with **unfair, asymmetric advantage** born from being in the system, not simply observing it.

While every fund has a framework, ours is simple and sharp:

### **Code. Capital. Customers. Community.**

Over the next few weeks, we’re unpacking what each of these really means — and why they matter in climate tech more than anywhere else. These aren’t vague values or marketing pillars. They’re a playbook. A stack. A philosophy of who we back and how we build.

### 🧱 CODE  
This isn’t just about writing software.  
It’s about writing the playbook — or knowing it cold. Code can be policy fluency, a hacked-together pilot, or a decade of grid operations encoded into intuition. We back founders who’ve built before — in syntax, systems, or sectors.

### 💰 CAPITAL  
We don’t wait for consensus.  
Our capital moves fast, supports weird, and gets the climate problem at a systems level. We don’t just pick winners — we help create conditions where real traction emerges.

### 🛠 CUSTOMERS  
Tech is meaningless without adoption.  
We’re obsessed with go-to-market: selling into bureaucracies, decoding procurement, and turning pilots into pipelines. We’ll help you find the customer who says yes when others say “send me a deck.”

### 🌐 COMMUNITY  
Community isn’t fluff. It’s infrastructure.  
It’s how talent circulates, how trust compounds, how asymmetric intel gets shared. We build community not for clout, but for compounding returns — and compounding resilience.

This isn’t a fund built on hype. It’s built on reality — and on the founders who live it every day.

Let’s get into it.
