Over the past four weeks, we’ve unpacked the core of how we invest — and why we believe the next generation of great climate companies will be built by those already inside the system.

Inside the agencies writing the policy.  
Inside the utilities navigating net-zero mandates.  
Inside the labs, the communities, the mandates, the red tape — and the real work.

At **Capitol Stack**, we exist to back these founders — the ones with **unfair, asymmetric advantage** born from being in the system, not simply observing it.

While every fund has a framework, ours is simple and sharp:

### **Code. Capital. Customers. Community.**

Over the past few weeks, we’ve explored what each of these really means — and why they matter in climate tech more than anywhere else. These aren’t vague values or marketing pillars. They’re a playbook. A stack. A philosophy of who we back and how we build.

---

### 🧱 CODE  
This isn’t just about writing software.  
It’s about writing the playbook — or knowing it cold. Code can be policy fluency, a hacked-together pilot, or a decade of grid operations encoded into intuition. We back founders who’ve built before — in syntax, systems, or sectors.

### 💰 CAPITAL  
We don’t wait for consensus.  
Our capital moves fast, supports weird, and gets the climate problem at a systems level. We don’t just pick winners — we help create conditions where real traction emerges.

### 🛠 CUSTOMERS  
Tech is meaningless without adoption.  
We’re obsessed with go-to-market: selling into bureaucracies, decoding procurement, and turning pilots into pipelines. We’ll help you find the customer who says yes when others say “send me a deck.”

### 🌐 COMMUNITY  
Community isn’t fluff. It’s infrastructure.  
It’s how talent circulates, how trust compounds, how asymmetric intel gets shared. We build community not for clout, but for compounding returns — and compounding resilience.

This isn’t just our thesis. It’s our filter.  
It’s how we select, how we support, and how we scale climate companies that *don’t need to fake traction — because they’ve already earned it.*

Next week, we’ll share what we’ve built behind this philosophy.

**Capitol Stack** is more than a name. It’s the architecture behind our conviction.
