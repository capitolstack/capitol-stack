During the past two Tuesdays, we unpacked our first pillars:

1. **Code Is More Than Code** – how regulatory fluency and lab‑grade IP are the new moats.  
2. **Capital Is Not a Commodity** – why blended, policy‑savvy capital turns FOAK cliffs into launch ramps.

Before we dive into **Customers** (1 July) and **Community** (8 July), here’s the four‑C framework—and the data behind it.

## Why Insider Founders Outperform

- **67 %** of deep‑tech founders come from public labs or government roles (Engine Insight).  
- Climate VC fell to **$30 B** in 2024 (‑14 % YoY, CTVC), yet insider‑led rounds closed **2–3 × faster**.  
- **51 %** of investors now rely on catalytic & blended stacks for first‑commercial projects (CTVC).

## 🧱 CODE — Expertise Compiled

An EPA chemist shortened a toxic‑materials permit from nine months to three because they’d helped write the rule. That’s compiled code.

## 💰 CAPITAL — Force Multiplier

A waste‑heat‑to‑power startup paired DOE LPO debt with equity, slicing 300 bps off cost of capital and locking an offtake before shovels hit dirt.

## 🛠 CUSTOMERS — Demand as Due Diligence

Insider founders know the buying committee, not just the buyer. One former municipal EV‑charger lead converted a pilot into a city‑wide contract in six weeks—saving a year of sales cycle.

## 🌐 COMMUNITY — Compounding Moats

Community is information liquidity. Our *Stacks & Snacks* dinners unite policy drafters, grid engineers, and procurement chiefs—turning loose ties into leverage. Portfolio founders have already hired 20+ teammates from that network.

### Mini Case Study — Four‑C Flywheel

- **CODE:** 10 years of utility outage data embedded in an AI‑vision model  
- **CAPITAL:** $12 M Series A + LPO conditional commitment in 4 months  
- **CUSTOMER:** Pilot → 7‑year contract with former employer utility  
- **COMMUNITY:** Slack workspace of 200+ utility data engineers fuels hiring & product feedback  

*Result: eight‑figure revenue forecast in 30 months.*

## Checklist — Are You Ready?

- Insider **code** (policy, ops data, lab IP)?  
- **Capital** partners who unlock grants/LPO?  
- First **customer** with budget & clear trigger?  
- A **community** flywheel that compounds intel?

If you answered yes to two or more, let’s talk.
