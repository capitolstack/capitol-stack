When most investors hear “code,” they picture someone hunched over a laptop, stringing together lines of Python or JavaScript. But at Capitol Stack, we’ve learned that the most valuable “code” in climate isn’t always written with keystrokes — it’s embedded in the minds of founders who’ve lived deep inside systems the rest of the world barely understands.

Sometimes code looks like a script. Other times it looks like a policy memo. Or a dataset no one else even knows exists.

Take the founder who spent a decade inside a federal agency helping to design hydrogen funding mechanisms. Now she’s building a startup perfectly tuned to the contours of that same policy. That’s code. It’s not on GitHub — it’s in her bloodstream.

Another founder helped craft the IRS implementation guidance for 45Q carbon capture credits. He knows, down to the paragraph, what qualifies as “secure geological storage” — and now he’s building a financing platform tailored to that niche. That’s policy as code.

Or look at the data. A soil scientist who spent years sampling regenerative farmland has built a proprietary dataset of carbon flux responses — data that doesn’t exist in any public registry. Now that dataset trains a model that quantifies carbon drawdown more accurately than anything else on the market. That’s data as code.

Even science itself can be code. A postdoc battery chemist who spent a decade collecting degradation profiles in lab settings is now building battery form factors informed by years of firsthand experimentation. There’s no GitHub repo for that kind of insight — it’s locked into her judgment. That’s science as code.

At Capitol Stack, we think of **“code” as any embedded advantage that’s difficult to replicate**. It might take the form of proprietary data, domain fluency, or deep experience inside a government system, scientific institution, or industrial supply chain. This kind of code rarely shows up on a pitch deck. But when you spot it, it’s the clearest sign of a founder who is building from the inside out.

We back climate founders who *don’t* follow policy trends — because they shape them. We’re drawn to founders who know the pain points of grid interconnection, environmental permitting, or municipal procurement — because they’ve lived them. Their code is hard-won, often obscure, and completely non-obvious to traditional venture capital.

That’s the opportunity.

This is why Capitol Stack exists — to fund the builders who already know the system they’re about to disrupt. Not because they’re trying to break it. But because they’ve already debugged it.

**Code isn’t just software. It’s the hidden layer behind every great climate company.**
