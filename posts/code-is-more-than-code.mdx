summary: "In climate, the unfair advantage isn’t always software — it’s the insider edge that lets you build what others can’t. Code is also policy, data, science, and asymmetric information."

Too often, we think of "code" only in terms of lines written in Python or JavaScript. But in the world of climate tech, code means something broader — and far more potent.

At Capitol Stack, we think of code as a founder’s *unfair advantage*. That advantage might be software — sure — but it might also be domain-specific IP, access to private datasets, or deeply specialized knowledge about how things get built, bought, or regulated.

> We back climate founders who *don’t* follow policy trends — because they shape them.

We’re drawn to founders who know the pain points of grid interconnection, environmental permitting, or municipal procurement — because they’ve lived them. Their code is hard-won, often obscure, and completely non-obvious to traditional venture capital.

Sometimes, code *is* code. But sometimes it's:

- 📊 **Data as code**: Access to emissions, grid load, or sensor data that others can’t get.
- 🧪 **Science as code**: Deep understanding of electrochemistry, molecular design, or physics baked into a hardware startup.
- 🏛️ **Policy as code**: Founders who wrote climate incentives, then built a company to deliver on them.

These types of code are defensible, embedded, and hard to replicate — exactly the type of asymmetric advantage we look for. 

It’s why we’re not just looking for “software” companies. We’re looking for **climate insiders** — and that starts with rethinking what code really means.
