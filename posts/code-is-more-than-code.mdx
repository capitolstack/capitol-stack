"Code is not just what founders write. It’s what they know."

That’s the throughline behind every investment we make at Capitol Stack.

We back founders who’ve lived the problem — not just ones who’ve read the spec. And that means expanding how we think about “code.” Yes, software matters. But the deeper signal we look for is **embedded expertise**: regulatory fluency, system knowledge, and the kind of earned insight that doesn’t show up on a GitHub repo.

In a moment when AI can generate a full-stack MVP before your coffee cools, we’re reminded that code — the real kind — is about **judgment**, **context**, and **decisions under constraint**. Code is conviction, not just syntax.

And let’s be honest: if code alone were enough, the world's problems would already be solved in Python.

## 📡 The Pattern: Builders Who’ve Been There

Some of the most compelling founders we meet didn’t start out trying to become entrepreneurs. They started out trying to fix something that was fundamentally broken.

The pipeline we see includes:
- A former EPA scientist who helped write TSCA chemical policy — now building materials compliance software that makes safety scalable.
- A USAID program officer who saw firsthand how much time and money were wasted navigating opaque procurement channels — now using AI to simplify government grant ops.
- A grid reliability engineer who spent years inside a utility — now deploying computer vision and remote sensing to forecast distribution-line failures.

They didn’t “pivot” into climate. Climate found them.

Recent analysis from <a href="https://engine.xyz/what-is-tough-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Engine</a> found that 67% of deep tech founders had public sector or academic lab backgrounds. The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/lab-embedded-entrepreneurship-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOE’s Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs</a> have launched over 150 startups in five years, proving that institutional fluency can be venture-forming.

## 🧠 Code as Embedded Intelligence

“Code” can also be thought of as **cognitive infrastructure** — knowledge embedded in how systems work.

That might mean:
- **Policy code**: writing the rules that govern materials, emissions, or subsidies
- **Process code**: knowing what steps unlock progress inside regulated systems
- **Political code**: knowing how decisions actually get made

The best founders didn’t read about it — they ran it in production.

## 🧮 Data Points That Back the Thesis

- DOE’s LEEP program reports a 60%+ startup survival rate after 3 years.
- <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2023-analyst-note-climate-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchBook’s Q4 2023 Climate Tech Note</a> reports founders with government backgrounds outperform in capital efficiency.
- <a href="https://technical.ly/dc/2024/03/04/dc-technical-talent-shortage-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical.ly (2024)</a> notes over $1.2M invested to address D.C.’s climate and govtech talent gap.

## 🤖 Why AI Makes Embedded Knowledge Even More Valuable

AI can automate syntax — but not context.

You can’t prompt your way out of a bad hypothesis. You need sharp minds to ask sharp questions — the kind only lived experience can generate.

As one founder put it: “I don’t need AI to write code. I need it to compress 10 years of policy hell into something a machine can reason over.”

## 🪡 Stitched Into Systems

These founders aren’t “disrupting” from outside — they’re stitching from the inside.

We’ve seen this in carbon accounting, compliance, permitting, and more. They know where the system breaks — and how to fix it.

## 😏 Pun Intended

We’re looking for **source** code. Not just code someone can write, but the source of why they’re writing it.

Because when the product comes from the problem — not the pitch deck — magic happens.

## 🧠 Want to Share What You’re Building?

At Capitol Stack, we don’t just want to read your deck. We want to hear your story.

That’s why we’re launching **Stacks & Snacks** — a dinner series across the D.C. region to surface overlooked talent and founders who’ve lived the system from the inside. Small groups, real talk, good food. No pitching. Just meaningful conversations among people building from real-world experience.
