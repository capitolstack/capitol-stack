## The Glue Behind Every Great Founder

We’ve spent this series unpacking the full stack:  
**Code** as asymmetric knowledge.  
**Capital** as catalytic fuel.  
**Customers** as the signal that it works.  
**Community** as the moat.

But here’s the truth: **community was always doing more than its share.**

In climate, where the timelines are long and the terrain unfamiliar, community is what closes the trust gap.  
It’s what carries you across the valleys of death—technical, financial, and emotional.

### Code Needs a Peer Group

Behind every great climate coder is a Discord, a Slack, a DM thread.  
Writing the best carbon accounting framework doesn’t matter if you’re yelling into the void.  
Community is what helps the coder validate, ship, and stay sane.

### Capital Needs Context

Capital chases confidence.  
That confidence is often borrowed—from a recommender, a referrer, a co-signer.  
Early checks come from people who’ve seen you build before, or believe enough to bet on what’s next.  
No spreadsheet replaces that human layer.

### Customers Need the Network

Selling into a utility or agency is 10% tech, 90% trust.  
Community is your wedge in the door—the pilot site, the friendly ear, the shared alma mater.  
It’s the unscalable things that eventually scale.

### What We've Learned

- **Communities compound**: Trust builds over time. One warm intro today leads to three more next quarter.
- **Communities extend reputation**: Good actors get invited back. Bad ones don’t.
- **Communities stabilize emotion**: Founding is lonely. Networks catch you when you wobble.

This isn’t just soft power. It’s operational.

### The Capitol Stack Ethos

We don’t invest in ideas. We invest in founders with a stack—of skills, of insight, of trust.

And what makes that stack strong isn’t just the codebase or the model.  
It’s the **people around them**.

Thanks for reading the Capitol Stack blog series.

*Founders, builders, skeptics, and believers — we’re building this with you.*

**Let’s keep going. Together.**
