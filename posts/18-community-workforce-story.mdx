## The Climate Workforce Gap

The climate transition is a labor problem. According to the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/building-a-workforce-for-a-clean-energy-future/), we‚Äôll need more than **1.5 million new workers** by 2030 in the U.S. alone‚Äîranging from solar installers and HVAC techs to grid modelers and carbon accountants.

Yet we still talk about the climate workforce as an afterthought. The headlines go to AI models and tech unicorns, while the boots-on-the-ground transformation goes underfunded and under-respected.

At Capitol Stack, we believe **community is the workforce story**. If we don‚Äôt build talent pipelines *into* our portfolio companies, we‚Äôre just moving money‚Äînot solving problems.

## Three Gaps, One Solution

1. **Narrative Gap** ‚Äì Most 18-year-olds don‚Äôt realize that becoming a certified heat-pump installer is both lucrative and climate-impactful. Community colleges and training programs need branding help as much as budget.
2. **Pathway Gap** ‚Äì The best founders create apprenticeships, not just job boards. We look for those who bake workforce into their go-to-market strategy.
3. **Capital Gap** ‚Äì It‚Äôs often non-dilutive capital (philanthropy, federal workforce grants, union co-investment) that unlocks talent scale. We help founders blend these sources.

## What We Look For

- Startups with **train-to-hire partnerships** baked into sales or service delivery  
- Founders who view local schools and unions as **strategic allies**, not ‚Äúnice-to-haves‚Äù  
- Companies building **new status symbols** for climate work (e.g., certifications, badges, hero content)

We back companies where **community is a multiplier**‚Äînot just for pilot wins, but for talent scale and retention.

## Case in Point: HeatLoop

HeatLoop builds prefab geothermal pods for K‚Äì12 campuses. But their edge isn‚Äôt just in product‚Äîit‚Äôs in **people**:

- Partnered with five vocational schools to create a **pipeline of certified installers**  
- Created branded field uniforms and microbadges recognized by local utilities  
- Won a DOE Workforce Innovation grant to scale training alongside deployments

Within 18 months, they hired 52 people from those pipelines‚Äîand unlocked 4 citywide school contracts.

## Checklist

- Are your **employees future employees** already in the community?  
- Have you unlocked **non-dilutive funding** for workforce?  
- Would a high-school student get excited about your **job ad**?

Climate capital needs to think beyond code. At Capitol Stack, we fund community stacks that double as workforce engines.
